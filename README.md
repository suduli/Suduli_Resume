## üß© Modifying the Skills Explorer / Legacy Data

The redesigned Skills & Expertise section is data-driven. Update or extend skills by editing the `SKILLS_DATA` array inside `script.js` ("Skills Explorer Redesign" block). A previous separate `/skills` directory (multiple style variants + rotating orbit visualization) has been fully removed. Its simpler data set was merged under the constant `LEGACY_SKILLS` in `script.js` for historical reference or future reuse.

Skill object schema:
```
{
  id: 'unique-id',
  name: 'Skill Name',
  category: 'Category Group',        // Used for grouping & filtering
  level: 0-100,                      // Numeric proficiency (visual bar)
  description: 'Short descriptive sentence.',
  keywords: ['search','tags'],       // Aids search & tag rendering (first 5 shown)
  attributes: { Key:'Value', ... }   // Rendered in detail panel as definition list
}
```

Add a new category simply by introducing a new `category` value. Color assignment is deterministic (hash ‚Üí palette) so no extra config required. The legacy color function is still exposed (`legacyColorForCategory`) but can be removed later if unused.

Accessibility notes:
- All interactive elements have focus styles and ARIA labels.
- Results region uses `aria-live="polite"` for count updates.
- List view groups are accordion sections with proper `aria-expanded` states.
- Press `/` anywhere to jump to search.

To switch default view mode, change the `activeView` initialization (`grid` or `list`). User preference persists via `localStorage` key `skillsViewMode`.

For any inquiries or collaborations, please use the contact form on the website or reach out through the provided contact methods.

## üì£ Recommendation Cards

The Recommendations section includes an interactive summary tile. Clicking anywhere on the summary content (the element with class `recommendation-info`) dynamically loads `Recommendations_Received.csv` and renders horizontally scrollable recommendation cards right below. Each card shows a concise excerpt by default and expands to reveal full text and fields on click. If CSV cannot be fetched from a local file context, a small sample is shown as a fallback. For accurate local testing, serve the site (e.g., `npm run dev`) so the CSV can be fetched over HTTP.
