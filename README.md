## üß© Modifying the Skills Explorer

The redesigned Skills & Expertise section is data-driven. Update or extend skills by editing the `SKILLS_DATA` array inside `script.js` ("Skills Explorer Redesign" block).

Skill object schema:
```
{
  id: 'unique-id',
  name: 'Skill Name',
  category: 'Category Group',        // Used for grouping & filtering
  level: 0-100,                      // Numeric proficiency (visual bar)
  description: 'Short descriptive sentence.',
  keywords: ['search','tags'],       // Aids search & tag rendering (first 5 shown)
  attributes: { Key:'Value', ... }   // Rendered in detail panel as definition list
}
```

Add a new category simply by introducing a new `category` value. Color assignment is deterministic (hash ‚Üí palette) so no extra config required.

Accessibility notes:
- All interactive elements have focus styles and ARIA labels.
- Results region uses `aria-live="polite"` for count updates.
- List view groups are accordion sections with proper `aria-expanded` states.
- Press `/` anywhere to jump to search.

To switch default view mode, change the `activeView` initialization (`grid` or `list`). User preference persists via `localStorage` key `skillsViewMode`.

For any inquiries or collaborations, please use the contact form on the website or reach out through the provided contact methods.
