# Mobile "About Me" Section - Debug & Fix Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Layout and Overflow Issues**
**Problems:**
- Text content potentially running off screen on small devices
- Horizontal scrolling on mobile devices
- Stats not stacking properly on mobile

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Changed `.about-content` from grid to flexbox with `flex-direction: column`
- Added `max-width: 100vw` and `box-sizing: border-box` to prevent overflow
- Implemented responsive container padding: `padding: 0 16px` on mobile
- Added `overflow-x: hidden` to body and sections

### 2. **Typography and Readability**
**Problems:**
- Font sizes too large for mobile screens
- Line height and spacing issues
- Text breaking awkwardly

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Responsive font sizes using `clamp()`: 
  - `about-intro`: `font-size: 20px` → `18px` on small mobile
  - `about-details`: `font-size: 16px` → `15px` on small mobile
- Added `word-wrap: break-word` and `hyphens: auto`
- Improved line heights for better readability

### 3. **Stats Section Layout**
**Problems:**
- Stats boxes not stacking properly on mobile
- Numbers like "8+ Years Experience" potentially splitting across lines
- Inconsistent spacing and gaps

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Changed stats layout to `flex-direction: column` on mobile
- Added consistent gap of `16px` between stat items
- Centered stats container with `max-width: 320px` and `margin: 0 auto`
- Implemented tablet-friendly grid: `repeat(3, 1fr)` on medium screens

### 4. **Button and Interactive Elements**
**Problems:**
- Buttons too small for touch interaction
- Inconsistent button spacing and alignment
- Hero buttons not mobile-optimized

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Increased minimum touch target size to `48px` (WCAG compliant)
- Enhanced button padding: `padding: 16px 20px`
- Made hero buttons full-width with `max-width: 280px`
- Added proper flex layout for button stacking
- Improved button visual feedback on touch

### 5. **Image and Visual Elements**
**Problems:**
- Profile placeholder image too large on mobile
- Poor visual hierarchy on small screens

**Solutions Implemented:**
- Responsive image sizes:
  - Mobile: `180px × 180px`
  - Small mobile: `160px × 160px`
  - Landscape: `120px × 120px`
- Reordered content: image first, then text content
- Adjusted icon sizes proportionally
