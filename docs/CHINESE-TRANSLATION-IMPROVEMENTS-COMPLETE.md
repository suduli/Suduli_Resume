## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:

1. **translations/zh.json** - Added comprehensive translation keys
2. **assets/js/core/main.js** - Updated skills display functions to use translated category names
3. **test-chinese-improvements.html** - Created test file to verify all improvements

### Translation System Integration:

- All improvements leverage the existing language switcher system
- Fallback mechanisms in place for missing translations
- Consistent with existing translation structure and patterns
- Properly integrated with the visitor counter system

## Testing

Created a comprehensive test file (`test-chinese-improvements.html`) that verifies:
- Skills category translations
- Skills count translations  
- Projects details button translation
- Testimonials section translations
- Contact form label translations
- Site analytics translations

## Usage Instructions

1. Switch to Chinese language using the language switcher
2. All previously untranslated elements should now display in Chinese
3. Skills section should show translated category names and skill counts
4. Projects should show "详情" instead of "Details"
5. Testimonials should show proper Chinese metrics labels
6. Contact form should have Chinese ARIA labels
7. Visitor counter should show "访问统计" and other Chinese labels

## Verification

You can verify the improvements by:
1. Opening `test-chinese-improvements.html` in a browser
2. Switching to Chinese (中文) language
3. Checking that all test sections display Chinese translations
4. Verifying the main website (`index.html`) with Chinese language selected

## Quality Assurance

- All translations follow simplified Chinese conventions
- Terminology is consistent with automotive/technical context
- Professional language appropriate for a resume website
- Maintains the same meaning and tone as English originals
- Proper integration with existing translation infrastructure

## Future Considerations

- Monitor for any additional untranslated elements that may appear
- Consider adding pinyin versions for accessibility
- Test with various Chinese input methods and browsers
- Regular review of technical terminology for accuracy
