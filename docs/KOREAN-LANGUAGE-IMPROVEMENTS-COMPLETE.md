  - "Testing" → "테스트"
  - "Tools" → "도구"
  - "Version Control" → "버전 관리"
  - "Learning" → "학습"
- Changed skill count labels from "skills"/"skill" to "기술"
- Updated ARIA labels for accessibility

### 2. **Projects Section**

- Added missing project translation keys:
  - `projects.details`: "자세히 보기"
  - `projects.github`: "GitHub" 
  - `projects.demo`: "라이브 데모"

### 3. **Testimonials/Recommendations Section**
**Issue:** Labels and summary text were in English
**Solution:**
- Added comprehensive translations:
  - `recommendations.testimonial_title`: "2025년 받은 추천서"
  - `recommendations.recommendations_this_year`: "올해 추천 수"  
  - `recommendations.total_recommendations`: "총 추천 수"
  - `recommendations.description`: "자동차 분야의 테스팅 및 검증 전문성을 입증하는 동료와 고객의 평가"

### 4. **Contact Form**
**Issue:** Form labels, placeholders, and ARIA descriptions were in English
**Solution:**
- Added proper Korean form translations:
  - `contact.form.labels.name`: "이름"
  - `contact.form.labels.email`: "이메일 주소"
  - `contact.form.labels.message`: "메시지"
- Updated placeholders and ARIA labels for accessibility

### 5. **Visitor Counter/Analytics Section**

- Ensured all statistics display in Korean

### 7. **Hero Section Duplication**
